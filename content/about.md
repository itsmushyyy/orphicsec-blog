# About me

I'm Miguel. I've worked across various fields ranging from flipping burguers, to sales,
to even health care, but my driving passion has always been the ones and zeros.
I've always been fascinated on how to both break and build things, and the fact that
you could be constantly learning with a computer was an amazing world to dream on.

In 2015 I started to learn how to administer windows servers and how to build ugly
websites. In 2017 I was setting up mail servers from scratch and getting lost on the
confusing world of Active Directory management.

After a couple of years rotting in the SOC graveyard shift hell, I landed an opportunity
to work directly in a DevSecOps enviroment, where I learned to hate Scrum and Agile
methodologies, while also falling in love with code and automation.

Right now, fully focused on Blue Team and CSIRT Operations.

When I'm not learning something new, I'm probably engaging in some kind of challenge or CTF:
