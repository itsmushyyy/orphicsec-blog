I’m not a fan of it either. Unfortunately, generative AI seems to be the only way I, as someone with little artistic talent, can “afford” more sophisticated graphics.

With a growing readership on this very niche website of mine, the amount of reader feedback I receive, primarily via email, but also through the community channel, has noticeably increased. This is something that brings me joy, and I’m happy to respond to everyone who reaches out, whether that’s with replies to questions, help on specific topics, or just a simple “thank you” message.

However, for the past year, I’ve been receiving an increasing number of comments about my use of generative AI imagery in some of the posts on this website. While all the comments have been in good spirit, they share one thing in common: A dislike for such graphics, along with well-intentioned suggestions to avoid future use of generative AI for cover art or inline “artwork”.

Because of the repeated feedback on this specific topic, I decided to write this post to explain myself and the situation I’m facing with this website.

# Up until now

Up until now

This website has been around for over half a decade now, during which I’ve dedicated considerable effort to producing original writing, photography and sometimes graphics for roughly 130 articles (not counting regular pages). Out of this content, only around 10 posts (~7%) feature imagery produced by generative AI, which I always disclose, usually in the article’s footer, and sometimes with slightly sarcastic remarks about generative AI.

However, despite my focus on original work, I’ve never received feedback explicitly appreciating the artwork featured in the remaining 93% of the posts. While the purpose of good artwork is to blend in with the writing and thus become one, it is nevertheless disheartening to see that as soon as I introduced generated images, I received immediate feedback, despite the fact that these images blended in better than any of my original
